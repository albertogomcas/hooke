What is it?
===========

It is a software for the (semiautomatic) analysis and filtering of
force curves. Force curves are the output of an analytical technique
called force spectroscopy. A force spectroscopy experiment usually
requires the analysis of thousands of force curves at a time. As of
today, there is no standard, free software for the analysis of force
curves. Hooke aims to solve that.


What it does?
=============

  * View, annotate, measure force curves
  * Worm-like chain and freely-jointed chain fit of force peaks
  * Automatic convolution-based filtering of empty curves
  * Automatic fit and measurement of multiple force peaks
  * Handles force-clamp force experiments (experimental)
  * It is extensible by users by mean of plugins and drivers

Troubleshooting
===============

If you have troubles in using it, before throwing it in the trash:

1. Search the issue tracker.
     http://code.google.com/p/hooke/issues/list
2. Look at the trouble shooting wiki page.
     http://code.google.com/p/hooke/wiki/TroubleShooting
3. Search the discussion group.
     http://groups.google.com/group/hookesoftware
4. Ask a question in the discussion group.
5. File a bug on the issue tracker.


Disclaimer
==========

Remember that Hooke is still experimental software! It has been mostly
done to fit the needs of its authors, and there is no guarantee it
will do what you need. However, you can write us/help us improve it so
that it does. We aim to make of Hooke a robust tool that can help your
research.
