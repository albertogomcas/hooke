Hooke_ is software for the (semiautomatic) analysis and filtering of
force curves.  Force curves are the output of an analytical technique
called `force spectroscopy`_.  Force spectroscopy experiments usually
require the analysis of thousands of force curves at a time. As of
today, there is no standard, free software for the analysis of force
curves. Hooke aims to solve that.

.. _force spectroscopy: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_spectroscopy

Features:

* View, annotate, and measure force curves
* Worm-like chain and freely-jointed chain fits of force peaks
* Automatic convolution-based filtering of empty curves
* Automatic fit and measurement of multiple force peaks
* Handles force-clamp force experiments (experimental)
* Extensible by users by mean of plugins and drivers

Remember that Hooke is still experimental software!  It has been
mostly done to fit the needs of its authors, and there is no guarantee
it will do what you need.  However, you can write us/help us improve
it so that it does.
