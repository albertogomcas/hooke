Installing Hooke
****************

Dependencies
============

Hooke is routinely run successfully on Windows and Linux based
systems. It is possible to run it happily on Mac OS X (though install
can be a bit trickier). Technically, Hooke should run wherever the
Python_ programming language is installed.

You'll need the following Python modules:

* Numpy_
* Scipy_
* Matplotlib_ (for generating plots)
* wxPython_ (for the GUI)

.. _Numpy: http://numpy.scipy.org/
.. _Scipy: http://www.scipy.org/
.. _Python: http://www.python.org/
.. _Matplotlib: http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/
.. _wxPython: http://www.wxpython.org/

Getting the source
==================

Hooke_ is available as an Subversion_ repository::

    $ svn checkout http://hooke.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ hooke

There is also a `GUI fork`_ (Rolf Schmidt)::

    $ svn checkout http://hooke.googlecode.com/svn/branches/illysam/ hooke

And a `fork`_ versioned in Mercurial_ (W. Trevor King)::

    $ hg clone http://www.physics.drexel.edu/~wking/code/hg/hooke/ hooke

There are also periodic bundled releases.  See the homepage for each
fork for details.  For example, get the most recent snapshot of
Trevor's fork in zip form with::

     $ wget -O hooke.zip http://www.physics.drexel.edu/~wking/code/hg/hgwebdir.cgi/hooke/archive/tip.zip
     $ unzip hooke.zip

Installation
============

Run::

    $ python setup.py install

to install Hooke.  Run::

    $ python setup.py install --help

to see a list of installation options you may want to configure.

Running Hooke from the source directory
=======================================

If you like, you can avoid installation by running Hooke directly from
it's source directory::

     $ wget -O hooke.zip http://www.physics.drexel.edu/~wking/code/hg/hgwebdir.cgi/hooke/archive/tip.zip
     $ unzip hooke.zip
     $ cd hooke
     $ python bin/hooke

You may need to give the full path for Python on Windows systems, and
also check that the current working directory (`.`) is in your
`PYTHONPATH`.  See :manpage:`python(1)` for details.
