Hooke's test framework is build using doctest_, unittest_, and nose_.
``nosetests`` (from the nose_ package) scans through the source tree,
searching out the various tests and running them.  If you aren't
familiar with nose_, there is excellent documentation on its home
page.  We use nose_ because its auto-discovery allows us to avoid
collecting all of our assorted tests into
:class:`unittest.TestSuite`\s and running them by hand.

To run the test suite from the Hooke installation directory, just use::

    nosetests --with-doctest --doctest-tests

.. _doctest: http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html
.. _unittest: http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html
.. _nose: http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/0.11.3/


Adding tests to modules
-----------------------

Just go crazy with doctests and unittests; nose_ will find them.
