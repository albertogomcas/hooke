default.cal is albedomanu's piezo calibration file
  /etc/opt/jpkspm-config-3.3.1/instruments/JPK00343/calibrations/default.cal
The path is stored in the force curve zip file in
  segments/*/segment-header.properties
as the value for
  channel.<CHANNEL-NAME>.conversion-set.conversion.<CONVERSION-NAME>.file
  channel.height.conversion-set.conversion.calibrated.file
but can be overridden by an attrubute in the XML playlist,
  <CHANNEL-NAME>_<SOURCE-CONVERSION-NAME>_to_<CONVERSION-NAME>_calibration_file
  height_nominal_to_calibrated_calibration_file="default.cal"
Relative paths are rooted in the same directory as the curve file.
