30 curves of octomeric-I27 using a modified Veeco Multimode.

Contributed by W. Trevor King.

Note that the bulk of the cantilever calibration data has been left
out of calibrate_cantilever/20100504/ to save space.  We retain only
the summary output file 20100504134510_calib_analysis_text.

In a production environment, other days' experiments and calibration
data goes into other YYYYMMDD-stamped subdirectories of unfold/ and
calibrate_cantilever/, so we retain that directory structure here.
