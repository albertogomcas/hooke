#summary Basic introduction to Hooke usage for SMFS force curves
#labels Featured,Phase-Support

IN PROGRESS

Hooke works with a combined command line and graphic interface. Think of programs like RasMol. The command line allows the user to issue commands about the set of curves he wants to analyze. The graphic interface, for now, shows the curves plot and allows basic interactions with it -depending also from variables and commands issued.

=Starting Hooke=
Open a terminal, go to the directory Hooke is installed and type python
hooke.py (You may need to give the full path for Python on Windows sys-
tems). If everything is OK, Hooke displays a nice splashscreen and starts.

Once Hooke is launched from the terminal window, you see a text like the following:

{{{

Hooke tells you that plugins and drivers have been loaded, and now you’re ready to go. You’re now at the Hooke command line. In the meantime, a splashscreen and a window with a dummy force curve should appear . At the command line, digit *help* or *?* to obtain a list of available commands.
