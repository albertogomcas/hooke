#summary File format support
#labels Phase-Design,Phase-Requirements

We need full support for most force spectroscopy data files. Please help us:
  * by giving us example data files
  * by giving us specifications of data files
  * by testing code and reporting bugs

= Supported file formats =

  * *Veeco Picoforce (6.x)*
    drivers: picoforce.py ; picoforcealt.py (depends on your version of Picoforce)


  * *JPK* (experimental support; needs testing!)
    drivers: jpk.py

  * *MFP 1D* (indirect) (needs testing)
    drivers: mfp1dexport.py
    Still _indirect_ support, requires Igor export scripts provided by Rolf Schmidt et al. available in the subversion reporsitory. See Mfp1dSupport for the details.

  * Simple *comma-separated values*
    drivers: csv.py
    Basically little more than a proof of concept, but one can build useful drivers on top of it.

= To do file formats =

  * Asylum MFP 1D
  * Anything else...
