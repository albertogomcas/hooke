Hooke requires:
  * Python 2.5
  * wxPython 2.8.x.x
  * Numpy 1.0.x
  * Scipy >=0.6.x
  * Matplotlib =0.91.x
  * wxMPL 1.2.9

All libraries are open source, free of charge and available on the Internet.
The packages should be installed in the order in which they are mentioned above.

*IMPORTANT*: wxMPL currently doesn't work with latest matplotlib (0.98). A patched wxmpl can be found in the Downloads section if you cannot install matplotlib 0.91 , but it can show a few bugs.
