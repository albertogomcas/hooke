  * *correct* Tells Hooke to correct a velocity clamp force curve for deﬂection or not. The default is 1 (true). By typing set correct 0 Hooke stops correcting to give the true
tip-surface extension and returns the piezo-setpoint extension.
  * *medfilt* Tells Hooke to smooth the curve showed with a simple median ﬁlter. The value of the variable is the amplitude of the running window: a larger window means a smoother ﬁlter. By default medﬁlt is set to 0, that is no ﬁltering. Try for example set medﬁlt 7 or larger to clearly see the effects. 
  * *xaxes* and *yaxes* ﬂip the X and Y axes, respectively. By default they are set to 0. Try setting them to 1 to ﬂip the plot (Bug warning: sometimes the default orientation can come back after zooming)
